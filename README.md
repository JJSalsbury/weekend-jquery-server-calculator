# Project Name
Weekend Jquery Server Calculator

## Description
_Duration: Weekend Homework Assignment (Thurs-Fri)_

I created an application that will calculate math operations as directed by user interaction.

Once user input is submitted using a equal button, the app collects the information, calculates a result and displays that result to the DOM. 

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Jquery.js](https://jquery.com/)
- [[bootstrap.css](https://jquery.com/)

## Usage

1. Enter numbers to be calculated in the user input fields.
2. Click clear button (c) to clear input fields as needed.
3. Click on math operation to be performed.
4. CLick equal button (=) to calculate answer.


## Built With

-Javascript
-Jquery
-Css
